/**
 *  This sample program illustrates equivalence checking with S2E.
 *  It contains two implementations of the factorial algorithm. Both
 *  implementations behave the same except in some corner cases.
 *  The main method calls the S2E custom instructions to perform
 *  equivalence checks.
 *
 *  Compile as follows:
 *  gcc -I /home/user/s2e/guest/include/ -std=c99 -o factorial factorial.c
