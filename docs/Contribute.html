<h1>Submitting patches</h1>
<p>S2E welcomes contributions of code (either fixing bugs or adding new functionality).
However, we get a lot of patches, and so we have some guidelines about submitting patches.
If you follow these, you'll help make our task of code review easier and your patch is likely to be committed faster.</p>
<p>Since S2E is based on QEMU, patch submissions mostly follow the QEMU <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch">guidelines</a>
(most of the text is taken from the QEMU wiki). Here are the relevant parts applicable to S2E.</p>
<p>All contributions to S2E must be <strong>sent as pull requests</strong> on GitHub. Please create an account and create a private fork of S2E.
Patch contributions should not be posted on the mailing list, bug tracker, posted on forums, or externally hosted and linked to.</p>
<p><strong>Patches must include a Signed-off-by: line</strong>.  For more information see
<a class="reference external" href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches;h=689e2371095cc5dfea9927120009341f369159aa;hb=f6f94e2ab1b33f0082ac22d71f66385a60d8157f#l297">SubmittingPatches 1.12</a>. This is vital or we will not be able to apply your patch! Please use your real name to sign a patch (not an alias name).</p>
<p><strong>Correct English</strong> is appreciated. If you are not sure, <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SpellCheck">codespell</a> or other programs
help finding the most common spelling mistakes in code and documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Patches should be against current git master</strong>. There's no point submitting a patch which is based on a
released version of S2E because development will have moved on from then and it probably won't even apply to master.</p>
<p><strong>Split up longer patches</strong> into a patch series of logical code changes.  Each change should compile and execute successfully.
For instance, don't add a file to the makefile in patch one and then add the file itself in patch two.
(This rule is here so that people can later use tools like <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">git bisect</a>
without hitting points in the commit history where S2E doesn't work for reasons unrelated to the bug they're chasing.)</p>
<p><strong>Patches that touch QEMU only</strong> should also be sent upstream. If your patch modifies QEMU and S2E, check whether the part
that changes QEMU could also be applied upstream. Split up the patch if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Don't include irrelevant changes</strong>. In particular, don't include formatting, coding style or whitespace
changes to bits of code that would otherwise not be touched by the patch.
(It's OK to fix coding style issues in the immediate area (few lines) of the lines you're changing.)
If you think a section of code really does need a reindent or other large-scale style fix,
submit this as a separate patch which makes no semantic changes; don't put it in the same patch as your bug fix.</p>
<p><strong>Write a good commit message</strong>. S2E follows the usual standard for git commit messages:
the first line (which becomes the email subject line) is &quot;single line summary of change&quot;.
Then there is a blank line and a more detailed description of the patch, another blank and your
Signed-off-by: line. Don't include comments like &quot;This is a suggestion for fixing this bug&quot;
(they can go below the &quot;---&quot; line in the email so they don't go into the final commit message).</p>

<p>The process for submitting larger contributions is the same as submitting bug fixes.
Everything goes through GitHub.</p>

<li>Your code must be documented. If you write a plugin, please add both the RST and the corresponding HTML file
to the documentation. The documentation should at least describe all the plugin settings and provide usage examples.
Please be as thorough as possible in the documentation. The clearer it is, the fewer questions will be asked.</li>
<li>Notes about coding style/commits/commit messages, etc. described in the previous section also apply here.</li>
