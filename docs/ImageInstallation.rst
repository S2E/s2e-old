Preparing VM Images for S2E
=============================

.. contents::

To run S2E, you need a QEMU-compatible virtual machine disk image. S2E can run
any x86 32-bit operating system inside the VM.
In this section, we describe how to build a Linux image and present general
requirements and guidelines for various operating systems.


Preparing a Linux VM Image
==========================

In the following, we describe how to install a minimal version of Debian Linux in QEMU.
S2E supports only 32-bit guest systems for now.

**Please make sure that you perform all the steps below using QEMU that ships with S2E.**
There will be compatibility problems if you use QEMU that comes with your system (especially
when saving/restoring snapshots).

``$S2EDIR`` refers to the directory where S2E is installed. The paths below assume you
followed the installation tutorials.

::

   $ # Create an empty disk image
   $ $S2EDIR/build/qemu-release/qemu-img create -f raw s2e_disk.raw 2G

   $ # Download debian install CD
   $ wget http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/debian-6.0.6-i386-businesscard.iso

   $ # Run QEMU and install the OS
   $ $S2EDIR/build/qemu-release/i386-softmmu/qemu-system-i386 s2e_disk.raw -cdrom debian-6.0.2.1-i386-businesscard.iso
   > Follow on-screen instructions to install Debian Linux inside VM
   > Select only "Standard System" component to install

   $ # When you system is installed and rebooted, run the following command
   $ # inside the guest to install C and C++ compilers
   guest$ su -c "apt-get install build-essential"

You have just set up a disk image in RAW format. You need to convert it to QCOW2 for optimal use
with S2E (the reasons for this are described in the next section).

::

   $ $S2EDIR/build/qemu-release/qemu-img convert -O qcow2 s2e_disk.raw s2e_disk.qcow2


General Requirements and Guidelines for VM Images
=================================================

There are no specific requirements for the OS image to make it runnable in S2E.
Any x86 32-bit image that boots in vanilla QEMU will work in S2E. However, we enumerate a list of tips
and optimizations that will make administration easier and symbolic execution faster.
*These tips should be used as guidelines and are not mandatory.*

Here is a checklist we recommend to follow:


* Install your operating system in the vanilla QEMU. It is the fastest approach. In general, all installation and setup tasks should be done in vanilla QEMU.

* Always keep a *RAW* image file of your setup. QEMU tends to corrupt *QCOW2* images over time. You can easily convert a RAW image into *QCOW2* using the *qemu-img* tool. Corruptions manifest by weird crashes that did not use to happen before.

* Keep a fresh copy of your OS installation. It is recommended to start with a fresh copy for each analysis task. For instance, if you use an image to test a device driver, avoid using this same image to analyze some spreadsheet component. One image = one analysis. It is easier to manage and your results will be easier to reproduce.

* Once your (QCOW2) image is set up and ready to be run in symbolic execution mode, take a snapshot and resume that snapshot in the S2E-enabled QEMU. This step is not necessary, but it greatly shortens boot times. Booting an image in S2E can take a (very) long time.

* It is recommended to use 128MiB of RAM for the guest OS (or less). S2E is not limited by the amount of memory in any way (it is 64-bit),  but your physical machine is.


The following checklist is specific to Windows guests. All common tips also apply here.



* Disable fancy desktop themes. Windows has a GUI, which consumes resources. Disabling all visual effects will make program analysis faster.
* Disable the screen saver.
* Disable unnecessary services to save memory and speed up the guest. Services like file sharing, printing, wireless network configuration, or firewall are useless unless you want to test them in S2E.
