  <h2>Standard Global Files</h2> 

  These are global files are always generated on a KLEE execution:
  <ol>
  <li><b>info</b>: This is a text file containing various information
  related to a KLEE run.  In particular, it records the exact
  command-line with which KLEE was run, and the total time taken by
  the execution.  E.g.:
    <pre class="output">
    $ cat info 
    klee --write-pcs demo.o
    PID: 12460
    Started: 2009-05-20 22:31:41
    BEGIN searcher description
    DFSSearcher
    END searcher description
    Finished: 2009-05-20 22:31:41
    Elapsed: 00:00:00
    KLEE: done: explored paths = 3
    KLEE: done: avg. constructs per query = 6
    KLEE: done: total queries = 3
    KLEE: done: valid queries = 0
    KLEE: done: invalid queriers = 3
    KLEE: done: query cex = 3
    KLEE: done: total instructions = 67
    KLEE: done: completed paths = 3
    KLEE: done: generated tests = 3 </pre>
  </li>

  <li><b>warnings.txt</b>: This is a text file containing all warnings emitted by KLEE.
  </li>

  <li><b>messages.txt</b>: This is a text file containing all other messages emitted by KLEE.
  </li>

  <li><b>assembly.ll</b>: This file contains a human readable version
  of the LLVM bitcode executed by KLEE

  <li><b>run.stats</b>: This is a text file containing various
  statistics emitted by KLEE.  While this file can be inspected
  manually, you should use the <a href="klee-tools.html">klee-stats</a>
  tool for that.</li>

  <li><b>run.istats</b>: This is a binary file containing global
  statistics emitted by KLEE for each line of code in the program.
  </li>

  </ol>

  
  <h2>Other Global Files</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><b>all-queries.pc:</b> This file contains all the queries KLEE
    made during execution in the <a href="KQuery.html">KQuery</a>
    format. Note these are the queries before any optimisation
    (e.g. caching, constraint independence) so it is possible that
    some of the queries logged are never executed by KLEE's underlying
    solver or are modified before being executed by KLEE's underlying
    solver. The generation of this file can be enabled by specifying
    the option <tt>--use-query-log=all:pc</tt> to KLEE.</li>
    <li><b>all-queries.smt2:</b> This file contains all the queries KLEE made during execution in the <a href="http://www.smtlib.org">SMT-LIBv2</a> 
    .It contains the same information as <tt>all-queries.pc</tt>. 
    The generation of this file can be enabled by specifying the option <tt>--use-query-log=all:smt2</tt> to KLEE.</li>
    <li><b>solver-queries.pc:</b> This file contains all the queries passed to KLEE's underlying solver during execution in the 
    <a href="KQuery.html">KQuery</a> format. Note these are the
    queries after all optimisations (e.g. caching, constraint
    independence) are performed.  The generation of this file can be
    enabled by specifying the
    option <tt>--use-query-log=solver:pc</tt> to KLEE.</li>
    <li><b>solver-queries.smt2:</b> This file contains all the queries passed to KLEE's underlying solver during execution in the 
    <a href="http://www.smtlib.org">SMT-LIBv2</a> 
    format. It contains the same information as <tt>solver-queries.pc</tt>. 
    The generation of this file can be enabled by specifying the option <tt>--use-query-log=solver:smt2</tt> to KLEE.</li>
  </ol>


  <h2> Per-path files</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>test&lt;N&gt;.ktest</b>: Contains the test case generated by
      KLEE on that path.  Use <a href="klee-tools.html">ktest-tool</a>
      to read the contents.  The generation of <tt>.ktest</tt> files
      can be disabled using the <tt>--no-output</tt> option.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>test&lt;N&gt;.&lt;error-type&gt;.err</b>: Generated for paths
      where KLEE found an error.  Contains information about the error
      in textual form.
    </li>

    <li><b>test&lt;N&gt;.pc:</b> Contains the constraints associated with the given
    path, in <a href="KQuery.html">KQuery</a> format.  The generation
    of these files can be enabled via the <tt>--write-cvcs</tt> flag.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>test&lt;N&gt;.cvc:</b> Contains the constraints associated
    with the given path,
    in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/stpfastprover/stp-documentation#TOC-The-CVC-language">CVC</a>
    format.  The generation of these files can be enabled via
    the <tt>--write-pcs</tt> flag.  (This is the same information as
    in the corresponding <tt>.pc</tt> file.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>test&lt;N&gt;.smt2:</b> Contains the constraints associated
    with the given path,
    in <a href="http://www.smtlib.org/">SMT-LIBv2</a>
    format.  The generation of these files can be enabled via
    the <tt>--write-smt2s</tt> flag.  (This is the same information as
    in the corresponding <tt>.pc</tt> file.)
    </li>
