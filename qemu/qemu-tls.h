/* Per-thread variables. Note that we only have implementations
 * which are really thread-local on Linux; the dummy implementations
 * define plain global variables.
 *
 * This means that for the moment use should be restricted to
 * per-VCPU variables, which are OK because:
 *  - the only -user mode supporting multiple VCPU threads is linux-user
 *  - TCG system mode is single-threaded regarding VCPUs
 *  - KVM system mode is multi-threaded but limited to Linux
 *
 * TODO: proper implementations via Win32 .tls sections and
 * POSIX pthread_getspecific.
